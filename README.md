# Simple-Web-Scraping
A simple python script to scrape a website, parse data, count words and store data into a local CSV file.

This python script uses Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.

Stop-words library is used to get a list of common stop words in order to omit them from the counting.

- Update with your domain of interest and a specific html tag for your case (e.g. main-container, content-area) in line 48.
- You can include your own defined stop words in line 29.
